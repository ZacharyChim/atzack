I Walk the Line
Johnny Cash
[Chorus]
         E                            A
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
          E                      A
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           D                         A
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               E                A
Because you're mine, I walk the line
[Verse]
         E                           A
I find it very, very easy to be true
          E                      A
I find myself alone when each day is through
           D                         A
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
               E                A
Because you're mine, I walk the line
         E                            A
As sure as night is dark and day is light
          E                      A
I keep you on my mind both day and night
           D                         A
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
               E                A
Because you're mine, I walk the line
[Chorus]
         E                            A
You've got a way to keep me on your side
          E                      A
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
           D                         A
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
               E                A
Because you're mine, I walk the line
```
