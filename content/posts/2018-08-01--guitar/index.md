I always wanted to learn how to play guitar, but can never keep on practicing for more than 2 months. Recently, I've made up my mind that I'm going to take it seriously. But firstly, I have to figure out why I gave up, what my prolbems were in learning guitar and what I was struggle with. If I can't solve these problems, I might give up again. And these problems might happen to many other guiter beginners, my solution could be a solution for them.

##Feeling lost? Lack of a "big picture" in the world of guitar?

We all start with some basic chords, some simple struming patterns and some easy songs that we like. But after several chords, patterns and songs, I felt like running in a hamster wheel, don't know where I was heading to or even where I was. So do I just keep remembering more chords and songs? What about the songs in which I know all the chords? Does this make me a better guitar player?  Am I moving forward or circling at the same place?

**Is there a map for a guitar learner?**
