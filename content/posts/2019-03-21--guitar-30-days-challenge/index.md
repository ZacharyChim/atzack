![30 Days Guitar Challenge](guitar.jpg)

I've been trying to learn guitar on and off. In the next 30 days, I want to push myself to spend much more time on practicing guitar. That's how I come up with the idea of 30 days guitar challenge. It's like a guitar boot camp for a beginner. I'm going to spend at least 2 hours a day, and the goal is to be able to play a new simple song everyday. It doesn't have to be perfect, just need to be able to finish it from the very beginning to the end. I know this is not the best way to learn guitar, but I believe, at least, it will give me a foundation.

But the biggest problem is that I don't really know what to practice. I don't want to choose random songs that I like, I hope I'm practicing some new technique in every song and moving forward on the way of learning guitar. Fortunately, [Justin](https://www.justinguitar.com/site-map-and-lesson-structure) provided a well-structured road map for learning guitar. It is great starting point, although I wish that there is a road map for all the important guitar skills.

Anyway, here is my practice plan.
