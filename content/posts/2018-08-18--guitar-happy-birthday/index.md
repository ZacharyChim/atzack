##Daily Guitar Practice 3 Happy Birthday

Today I will practice a really simple version of the song Happy birthday for ear training. And C scale is added to warm up after walking the notes.

A chord, D chord, and E chord are still on the list. Since these are my first set of chords, I'd like to spend more time on them. And the song I walk the line by Johnny Cash is a good practice for the chords.

1. Warm up
   * Finger stretch.
   * Walking the notes.
   * C Scale.

2. Revision: A, D, E Chords
   * Left hand: positions of fingers.
   * Right hand: all down strumming & base - down up.

3. Revision: I Walk The Line by Johnny Cash
   * Chords: E A E A D A E A
   * All down strum, 4 strums (1 bar) for each chord.

4. Ear training: Happy Birthday.
